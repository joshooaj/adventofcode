# Advent of Code in PowerShell

If you haven't tried Eric Wastl's Advent of Code puzzles already, and you're interested in coding or
scripting in any language what-so-ever, you should head over to [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)
and check it out!

PowerShell is my go-to language for quickly solving problems of just about any size and this repo
will hold whatever solutions I manage to complete before giving up and succumbing to the chaos of
the holidays.
